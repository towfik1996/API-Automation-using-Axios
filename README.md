# API-Automation-using-Axios
Axios is a popular JavaScript library that is commonly used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

Axios is often used for API automation because it provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests and handling responses. It supports various features like request and response interceptors, automatic transformation of JSON data, cancellation of requests, and much more.
